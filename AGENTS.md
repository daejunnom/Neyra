# Neyra development and delivery

- Keep the user's fixed-bag, Sonic Drop, adjustable success threshold, and
  minimum-lock objective. The 112-piece goal is an aspiration, not a rejection
  threshold. The v2 design remains implementation work until its acceptance
  criteria are demonstrated by real search results.
- The SRS+ authority is the ordered data and first-origin rotation behavior in
  TETR.IO's official tetrio.js. Clearra's corrected Rust profile is canonical;
  Neyra consumes the same reviewed fixture through scripts/generate-srs-plus.py.
  Do not maintain a second handwritten kick table or silently change the
  interpretation of O rotations and I half turns.
- Use focused verification for the changed behavior. Check generated rule data
  with `python3 scripts/generate-srs-plus.py --check` and use the committed
  lockfiles when testing Rust and building the Svelte/WASM site.
- The user has authorized the assistant to deploy completed requested Neyra
  changes. After verification, publish the normal non-force main update, follow
  the existing Test and deploy Pages workflow, and verify the deployed result.
  Do not leave deployment for the user to trigger manually, use `[skip ci]` for
  a delivery that is expected to publish, or report a source push as a successful
  deployment. Existing GitHub checks and access controls still apply.
- Keep source research, implementation status, and measured search results
  distinct. Do not copy private reference code into this public repository.
